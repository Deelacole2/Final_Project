*Team Members:* D'Ana Rogers, Lisa Binegar, Kola Oyedele, and Allison Bartlett


**Communication Protocols**

- Exchanged cell phone numbers and created a group text chain
- Google Document 
- Zoom meetings

**Topic**
- Medical deserts in the United States and to show the impact of medical deserts in rural areas. 

**Reason**
- As many hospital and care facilities close in the United States, this leaves communities vulnerable without immediate healthcare options. We want to show if a community is located in a medical desert, and if so, how does this correlate with things like mortality rate, heart attack deaths, and infant mortality in those areas. Based on hospital closures, we also want to predict areas that may be in danger of being in a medical desert in the future. 

**Data**
- US Hospital Location CSV from 
- Total Population and SVI from census.gov 
- Mortality and diease rates from CDC.gov
- State Cost of Living Index from AdvisorSmith
- US County Sociohealth data from Kaggle.com

**Questions**
- If the location being searched is in a medical desert? Does being in a medical desert coralate with other health factors, such as mortality rates. 

**Hypothesis** 
- Living in a medical desert will be correlated with poorer overall health outcomes. 

**Technologies, Languages, Tools, and Algorithms**
- Postgres
- AWS
