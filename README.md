## Machine Learning Model

##### The machine learning model used for this project is the LinearRegression model. This is because we seek to predict a continous data which is the Average Number of Physically Unhealthy Days in a county given certain feature variables. Using a data set with about 3000 records, each representing a county, and 79 of those counties are medical deserts, the data was split into test and train data. 743 records fell into the test category and the model achieved an accuracy of 87%. 
##### A map of the US was also made using Python's Folium library. The maps shows the counties that are medical deserts and a popup at those counties showing the county Name, State, Average Number of Physically Unhealthy Days, and SVI infortmation for the county.
