# Yellow Team Final Project
*Team Members:* D'Ana Rogers, Lisa Binegar, Kola Oyedele, and Allison Bartlett


**Topic**
- Medical deserts in the United States and to show the impact of medical deserts in rural areas. As many hospital and care facilities close in the United States, this leaves communities vulnerable without immediate healthcare options. We want to show if a community is located in a medical desert, and if so, how does this correlate with things like mortality rate, heart attack deaths, and infant mortality in those areas. Based on hospital closures, we also want to predict areas that may be in danger of being in a medical desert in the future. 
 

**Reason**
- We all had an intereste in a project that was healthcare related, as we all currently work in the industry. Healthcare is ever-changing and we thought it would be interesting to see how the health of a community is impacted by being located in a hospital deserts. With the US population growing but hospitals continuing to close, this could potential impact many people. 


**Data**
- US Hospital Location CSV from Kaggle.com
- Total Population and SVI from census.gov 
- Mortality and diease rates from CDC.gov
- State Cost of Living Index from AdvisorSmith

**Questions**
- If the location being searched is in a medical desert?  
- Do counties/states that have a higher percentage of medical deserts have overall poorer health care trends (higher mortality rates, disease rates, and higher SVI measurements)?
-  Are these regions at risk of additional hospital closures, or has a hospital closed in that region in the past five years? These are additional questions we would hope to provide some high-level answers to for a citizen or policy maker.

**Technologies, Languages, Tools, and Algorithms**
- Postgres
- AWS
- Tableau
- PySpark

 *Database Storage*

    Postgres is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask or Tableau to display the data.

 *Machine Learning*

    SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is Sklearn.linear_model.

 *Dashboard*

    Tableau Public to host our interactive dashboard
