# Yellow Team Final Project
*Team Members:* D'Ana Rogers, Lisa Binegar, Kola Oyedele, and Allison Bartlett


**Communication Protocols**
- 

**Topic**
- Medical deserts in the United States and to show the impact of medical deserts in rural areas. 

**Reason**
- As many hospital and care facilities close in the United States, this leaves communities vulnerable without immediate healthcare options. We want to show if a community is located in a medical desert, and if so, how does this correlate with things like mortality rate, heart attack deaths, and infant mortality in those areas. Based on hospital closures, we also want to predict areas that may be in danger of being in a medical desert in the future.
