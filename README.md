# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Postgres will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. 

## Database Storage
Postgres is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Flask or Tableau to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is Sklearn.linear_model. 

## Dashboard
We will use either D3.js or Tableau for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard.
